# Score Keeper
## A simple JavaScript Application Exercise.

---

Welcome to my Score Keeper! An application for implementing JavaScript with HTML and CSS.
This small application can be used for keeping score of simple games! You have access up to two players
and their score count at the top. You then choose how many rounds to go to. The first to reach the
preferred score, wins!

##### Features:

+ Two players and their scores nestled at the top of the page
+ You can program how many games to go to, using the input box
+ Check the player's box for whomever won points and this will display at the top
+ You may reset the amount of points needed to win the game at anytime, which will prompt the app to start over at 0 
+ You may also reset the whole app using the reset button

---

##### Updates:
+ Created a reset feature which changes the scoreboard back to 0 once the input box is suddenly changed: 5/23/2018
+ Initial Repository created: 5/29/2018
+ Refactoring the reset button to invoke and make legible: 5/29/2018
